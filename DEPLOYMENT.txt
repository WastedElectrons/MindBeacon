DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

The MindBeacon app is a standalone web application with no external dependencies.
The project contains both the server and client components and can be deployed 
as a .Net web application with no special considerations.

LIMITATIONS

Multiple MindBeacon apps may be deployed. However, as each app has it's own 
in memory cache there is a chance that sequential requests will return 
different results.

It's recommended to deploy MindBeacon as a singleton service.  If multiple 
services are required, use sticky sessions to force each client to use a
single instance.
